# Graph Data Structure (OOP Implementation)

This is a simple implementation of a **directed, weighted graph** using object-oriented programming in Python.

It uses three core classes:
- `Edge` – represents a connection from one vertex to another.
- `Vertex` – represents a node in the graph.
- `Graph` – manages a collection of vertices and their connections.

## 📘 Classes and Their Responsibilities

### 1. Edge
Represents an edge going from one vertex to another, with a given weight.

### 2.  Vertex
Represents a vertex in the graph. Stores a label (name) and a list of outgoing edges.

### 3.  Graph
Holds a list of vertices and provides methods to manipulate them and their edges.
